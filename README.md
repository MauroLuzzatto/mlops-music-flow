# MusicFlow API



MusicFlow is a music recommendation system that uses Spotify's API to predict the hypothetical number of song streams on Spotify using the Spotify audio features and track metadata.
This API uses a personal Spotify streaming history to train a machine learning model that predicts the number of streams for a given song.

The MusicFlow API is built using the FastAPI framework, which makes it fast, easy to use, and well-documented.

The number of streams in the dataset are are between X and Z streams.



## Example

### Prediction

Let's predict the number of streams for "The Less I know the better" from "Tame Impala":

[musicflow.link/prediction/?song=The Less I know the better&artist=Tame Impala](musicflow.link/prediction/?song=The%20Less%20I%20know%20the%20better&artist=Tame%20Impala)


Response:
```
{
    "song": "The Less I Know The Better",
    "artist": "Tame Impala",
    "prediction": 5.35,
    "description": (
        "The predicted number of future streams of the song based on the Spotify"
        " API audio features."
    ),
    "song_metadata": {
        "song": "The Less I Know The Better",
        "artist": ["Tame Impala"],
        "album": "Currents",
    },
    "message": {"emoji": "üòç", "text": "What a banger!"},
}
```

<!-- - `musicflow.link/health` - Returns the health status of the API. -->
- `musicflow.link/raw_features/?song={song}&artist={artist}` - Returns the "raw" audio features of a given song on Spotify.
- `musicflow.link/features/?song={song}&artist={artist}` - Returns the processed audio features of a given song on Spotify.
- `musicflow.link/prediction/?song={song}&artist={artist}` - Predicts the hypothetical number of song streams for a given song based on the Spotify audio features and track metadata.

## How to create your own musicflow API?


This repository provides instructions on how to request Spotify streaming history data, download it and create a dataset using music_flow, train a machine learning model, and set up an API using an AWS account.

### Getting Spotify API Access Client ID and Client Secret

To access the Spotify API, you need to create a Spotify Developer account and obtain a Client ID and Client Secret. Follow these steps:

- Go to the Spotify Developer Dashboard and log in with your Spotify account.
- Click on "Create an app" and fill out the required information.
- Once you have created the app, you will see your Client ID and Client Secret on the app dashboard.

### Requesting Spotify Streaming History

To request your Spotify streaming history, you need to follow these steps:

- Go to Spotify's Privacy Settings and log in with your Spotify account.
- Scroll down to "Download your data" and click on "Request".
- You will receive an email from Spotify when your data is ready to be downloaded.

### Downloading the Data and Creating a Dataset Using music_flow

Once you have received the email from Spotify, you can download your data and create a dataset using music_flow by following these steps:

- Download your data from Spotify and unzip the file.
- Install music_flow by running pip install music-flow.
- Create a Python script and use the music_flow library to load the data and create a dataset. Refer to the music_flow documentation for more information on how to do this.

### Training a Machine Learning Model

Once you have created your dataset, you can train a machine learning model by following these steps:

- Import your dataset into your machine learning environment.
- Preprocess the data as needed.
- Choose a machine learning algorithm and train the model.
- Test the model and evaluate its performance.

### Setting Up API Using an AWS Account

To set up an API with AWS SAM, follow these steps:

- Install AWS SAM CLI by following the instructions provided here.
- Create a new SAM project using the sam init command.
- Write the code for your Lambda function and API gateway in the appropriate files (e.g., app.py and template.yaml).
- Build and package your SAM application using the sam build and sam package commands.
- Deploy your SAM application using the sam deploy command.



## Train your own model
- get spotify API access client id and client secret
- request spotify streaming history
- download the data and create dataset using `music_flow`
- train machine learning model using `music_flow`
- setup API using an AWS account (needs to be setup)



## Next steps and ongoing work

- Version model
- Add logging
- Allow for continous training
- Use data classes for sample
- Make better feature processing pipeline
- Improve api reponse for formatted feature
- Deep learning



<!--
## Plan
- request streaming history from spotify
- find some random tracks (e.g kaggle datasets)
- calculate the numer of streams per track (=target values)
- download features for the tracks
- create the dataset containg the features and the number of streams
- train model using GridSearch
- save different model versions
- use API to serve model
- use API to predict number of streams per track -->
